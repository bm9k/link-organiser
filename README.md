**TL;DR**: Add a list of links, one on each line, and click shuffle to randomly organise them

TODO: add readme

Plans:
 - Convert to table form & add columns to each link: counter, checkbox, note, date clicked?
 - When link is clicked, check it automatically/increase counter
 - Shuffle only selected
 - Import/export
 - Preserve order of shuffling across page loads (store random seed in localstorage)
